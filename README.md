# The-Modern-React-Bootcamp-by-Colt-Steele
A Repository of my projects based on Colt Steele's Modern React Bootcamp

## All projects/exercises will be running in a docker container
You will need to log into the docker container and run npm start to start the server to run react 
use this command to exec a bash shell in the container to run commands
```
docker-compose exec (service) bash
```
You can find the service name in the docker-compose file under services

*Remember the server will be exposed and running on the port you defined in your docker-compose file so use that port when entering the server url into the browser*
